#Swift 3 Game Development - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Swift 3 Game Development - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/swift-3-game-development-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787127753), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Swift combined with Spritekit is the perfect choice for game development. With the announcement of Swift 3.0, developers are intrigued and want to make use of this programming language to develop games. Packed with best practices and easy-to-use examples, this book leads you step by step through the development of your first Swift game.
##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
import SpriteKit

class GameScene: SKScene {
    override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
    }
}
```

This book uses the Xcode IDE, version 8.2.1 (Swift 3). If you use a different version of Xcode, you will likely encounter syntax differences; Apple is constantly upgrading Swift’s syntax. You can use Xcode’s Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax to update the code examples in this book to a newer version of Xcode. Visit https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ to download Xcode. You will need an Apple developer account to integrate your apps with the Game Center and submit your games to the App Store.

Note: Chapter 1 has no code as it is an introductory chapter and Chapter 11 has no code files present.
